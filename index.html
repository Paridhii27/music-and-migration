  <body>
    In music and migration by John Baily and Michael Collyer we delve into some
    of these major ideas of music in the context of both migrants and refugees.
    Within the writing and making of this project I want to explore how migrants
    and refugees find a sense of connection between their past and present in
    terms of the songs composed and the memories embedded within them. Music
    often becomes a repository of memories and migration enables it to be a
    source of mobility of cultural forms. Finding out how music transmits
    cultural notions is something I’m interested in researching. How does music
    connect displaced communities, and can it contribute to the formation of new
    ones? Do the songs have a certain vocal modularity or tone associated with
    them? How do the songs preserve a sense of spatial and temporal memory of
    the migrants lived experiences? These are some questions I aim to find out
    during this project’s making.
