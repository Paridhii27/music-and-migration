        In music and migration by John Baily and Michael Collyer we delve into
        some of these major ideas of music in the context of both migrants and
        refugees. Within the writing and making of this project I want to
        explore how migrants and refugees find a sense of connection between
        their past and present in terms of the songs composed and the memories
        embedded within them. Music often becomes a repository of memories and
        migration enables it to be a source of mobility of cultural forms.
        Finding out how music transmits cultural notions is something I’m
        interested in researching. How does music connect displaced communities,
        and can it contribute to the formation of new ones? Do the songs have a
        certain vocal modularity or tone associated with them? How do the songs
        preserve a sense of spatial and temporal memory of the migrants lived
        experiences? These are some questions I aim to find out during this
        project’s making.
