      <h1>Music, Migration and Memories</h1>
      <p>Migration has been an important element for cultural exchange through the years. Bringing with it diverse music, art, languages and experiences across spatial and temporal boundaries. In the early years there was little interest in the phenomenon of migration in regards to music other than how it related to the diffusion of artefacts such as musical instruments from one culture to another. (Baily & Collyer, 2006, p. 168) However, over the years migrants have now been identified as catalysts for cultural exchange leading to fusion of music styles and emergence of new musical genres. Such music serves as a repository of shared experiences, cultural heritage, and emotions connecting the past to the present. The music that emerges from migration often serves as a powerful dual force. At times, it acts as a painful reminder of the hardships and losses of the past, evoking feelings of longing, grief, or nostalgia. At other times, it becomes a means for the migrant to maintain a sense of connection to their home, tethering them to their roots as they navigate life in an unfamiliar land. </p>

        <h2>Blues</h2>
        <p>“During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the british slave trade brought ever incerasing numbers of West Africans, first only from the Gambia/ Senegal area, then from all along the Guinea coast to Jamestown and other Atlantic coastal towns” in North America (Kubik, 1999, p. 5) The slave trade was a forceful migration of millions of Africans to North America. During the journey from Africa, slave trade often encouraged dance and music among the captives on slave ships, to prevent their falling into depression and dying. (Kubik, 1999, p. 5) “In the intervals between their meals they [the slaves] are encouraged to divert themselves with music and dancing; for which purpose such rude and uncouth instruments as are used in Africa, are collected before their departure” These instruments being categorized as rude and uncouth represents the severity of oppression felt during the time by the african community. As these african musical instruments such as bowed lutes, two stringed plucked lutes, flutes, drums and  senegambian barafoo reached North America, african musicality began getting merged with that of the americans.  This fusion of African identity in a new american environment led to what we know today as Afro-american. This was the beginning of blues. 

          Today it's no longer possible to hear the history of the blues from the mouths of many of those who shaped it. The survivors of the first decades are few; memories are dimmed by age and scarred by experience. Time and pride have coloured some recollections, distrust and envy may have distorted others. Fingers are no longer nimble when old men are asked to play; blues that were sung in youth may have little meaning when the heat of the moment has been long forgotten. The problems of piecing together the story of the blues are many. It’s a sociological axiom that the observer changes the nature of the subject observed by the very act of observation. Not only does his presence change the circumstances that exist when he is not present but the structure of his own research, and the kind of interpretation that he makes from the material he gains, may subtly distort the image of the subject. This is a principle which is evident in the differing ways in which the blues is seen today. For some people it is infinitely glamorous, for others it is a symbol of the oppression of a racial minority. For some African Americans today it is part of a proud tradition while for others it is the last brand of the plantation, and humiliating. There are some who view the blues as a music of protest and some who consider it a music of self-pity; there are those who consider it important primarily as an influence on jazz. (Oliver, 1997, p. 2)

        <h2>Hip Hop</h2>
        <p>Hiphop emerged from the cultural crossroads created by migration and how it serves as a powerful medium for expressing the memories, challenges, and aspirations of those whose lives have been shaped by displacement and the experience of forging new identities in unfamiliar lands. Hip-hop gives a voice to the otherwise voiceless. A voice for the minorities who are marginalized. Hip-hop's connective marginalities are social resonances between black expressive culture within its contextual political history and similar dynamics in other nations. Contemporary hip-hop groups from the Mezzogiorno also express solidarity with neighboring Mediterranean cultures through the lyrics of their songs.

        <h2>Reggae</h2>
        <p> Reggae is a musical genre that originated in the Jamaican ghettos. It combines African, Caribbean, and American musical traditions, shaped by migration and cultural exchange
          Rocksteady, a precursor to reggae, consists of songs that are “expressive of the people’s suffering, their everyday life, and their attitude towards the society in which they live[d].” (King, 2001, p. 28 ) Music often becomes a means of expressing dissent and sadness. Music of the migrants carries with it a range of emotions.
