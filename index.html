      <h1>Music, Migration and Memories</h1>
      <h2>What are the ways in which migration connects to music?</h2>
      <p>Migration has been an important element for cultural exchange through the years. Bringing with it diverse music, art, languages and experiences across spatial and temporal boundaries. In the early years there was little interest in the phenomenon of migration in regards to music other than how it related to the diffusion of artefacts such as musical instruments from one culture to another. (Baily & Collyer, 2006, p. 168) However, over the years migrants have now been identified as catalysts for cultural exchange leading to fusion of music styles and emergence of new musical genres. Such music serves as a repository of shared experiences, cultural heritage, and emotions connecting the past to the present. The music that emerges from migration often serves as a powerful dual force. At times, it acts as a painful reminder of the hardships and losses of the past, evoking feelings of longing, grief, or nostalgia. At other times, it becomes a means for the migrant to maintain a sense of connection to their home, tethering them to their roots as they navigate life in an unfamiliar land. </p>
      <h2>What kinds of memories are intricately connected to the music that emerges as a result of migration?</h2>
      <p>Memories help construct a reality inspired by the past and looking to the future. The songs are imbued with cultural influences from both the migrant's homeland and their new country, blending these elements to reflect their dual identity.  However, these migrant memories lead to the construction of a reality that is specific to them and their experiences. The structure of the music takes into consideration their structure of memory (Snyder, 2000, p. 3) recognising that music itself reflects the way an individual recalls and organizes experiences. Memories, especially those of migrants, are constantly evolving, shaped by the passing of time and the shifting nature of perception. These perceptions are stored in short-term memory, and lead to the modification of long-term memories. "Memories are dimmed by age and scarred by experience,"(Oliver, 1997, p. 1)  which, in turn, impacts the construction of long-term memories. This ongoing process of change in memory impacts how people form and express new realities through music, intertwining personal identities with collective cultural expressions.</p>

        <p>“During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the british slave trade brought ever incerasing numbers of West Africans, first only from the Gambia/ Senegal area, then from all along the Guinea coast to Jamestown and other Atlantic coastal towns” in North America (Kubik, 1999, p. 5) The slave trade was the forceful migration that uprooted the lives of millions of Africans. Onboard the slave ships, “In the intervals between their meals they [the slaves] [were] encouraged to divert themselves with music and dancing; for which purpose such rude and uncouth instruments as are used in Africa, [were] collected before their departure” This was encouraged to prevent the captives on slave ships from falling into depression and dying.  Describing African instruments as “rude and uncouth” reflects the severity of oppression felt during the time by the captive african community. Instruments like bowed lutes, two-stringed plucked lutes, flutes, drums, and the Senegambian barafoo were brought to North America, where African musicality began to merge with local American musical elements. This fusion of African identity with a new American environment laid the foundation for what is now known as Afro-American music, ultimately giving rise to the blues genre.</p>
        <p>“Today it's no longer possible to hear the history of the blues from the mouths of many of those who shaped it. The survivors of the first decades are few; memories are dimmed by age and scarred by experience. Time and pride have coloured some recollections, distrust and envy may have distorted others. Fingers are no longer nimble when old men are asked to play; blues that were sung in youth may have little meaning when the heat of the moment has been long forgotten.” (Oliver, 1997, p. 1) Memories fading, distorting and being forgotten with time. Blues is a music that seeks to capture the memories of loss, grief, and struggle, expressing the profound hardships and resilience of its origins. The music takes us back to the days it was created in, giving us a glimpse into the lived experiences of the people who sang the blues. “Blues is music and blues is song; blues singers are people. Blues is not text and blues singers are not pictures. But they aren’t discs of shellac or vinyl either. As the disembodied voices that struggle to be heard above the needle-scratch of old records may give some impression of the sounds of the blues, so this brief outline may place the blues singers in the contexts of the times and places where they lived and worked, and sang, and sometimes died” (Oliver, 1997, p. 4) </p>
        <p>”For some people it is infinitely glamorous, for others it is a symbol of the oppression of a racial minority. For some African Americans today it is part of a proud tradition while for others it is the last brand of the plantation, and humiliating. There are some who view the blues as a music of protest and some who consider it a music of self-pity; there are those who consider it important primarily as an influence on jazz. (Oliver, 1997, p. 2) You can look at it in many ways, it was the music reflecting the multitude of emotions felt by its singer from the depths of despair and heartache to the flickering light of hope and the enduring spirit of survival.

        <h2 class="genre-title">Hip Hop</h2>
        <p>Italian hip hop is an example of a music genre that evolved from migration of people, particularly the mass movement of people from the Mezzogiorno (southern Italy) to the industrialized cities in Northern Italy. This migration happened due to economic disparities between the south and north and the promise of better opportunities in the North.Following Italy's unification in the mid-nineteenth century, the Mezzogiorno, the country's underdeveloped southern region, became the subject of damaging negative stereotypes. The South was viewed as more African than European. Racism had been a major problem in Italy for a long time. “At the time of national unification, the South was politically underrepresented and consequently suffered disproportionately from injurious economic and social programs put in place by the new liberal regime. As happened in many colonized regions, the Mezzogiorno's underdevelopment was blamed on the supposedly uncivilized character of its inhabitants (Dickie 1999, 3).” (Dawson & Palumbo, 2005, p. 169 ) Thus, the north came to be seen as wealthy and developed while the south was considered backwards. At such a time hip hop became a means of expressing the frustrations stemming from the stark societal divides. 
        </p>
        <p>Hiphop emerged from the cultural crossroads created by the migration and served as a powerful medium for conveying the experiences of those who had been displaced and found themselves  forging new identities in unfamiliar lands. Hip hop groups from the Mezzogiorno, such as 99 Posse and the neapolitan group Bisca, wrote about these memories of migration and marginalization in their music. They challenged the negative perceptions of their culture and celebrated the richness of it instead. “Contemporary hip-hop groups from the Mezzogiorno also express solidarity with neighboring Mediterranean cultures through the lyrics of their songs.” (Dawson & Palumbo, 2005, p. 171 ) 
        </p>
        <p>Hip-hop became a way of giving a voice to the otherwise voiceless. A voice for the minorities who are marginalized. A voice to the underrepresented people who are often never heard otherwise. A moment to listen to unheard voices.

        <h2 class="genre-title">Reggae</h2>
        <p> Reggae is a musical genre that originated as a result of the migration of rural Jamaicans to urban centers like Kingston in the mid-20th century for finding economic opportunities. Its roots lie in earlier Jamaican musical genres such as ska and rocksteady. Rocksteady, a precursor to reggae, consists of songs that are “expressive of the people’s suffering, their everyday life, and their attitude towards the society in which they live[d].” (King, 2001, p. 28 ) Music often becomes a means of expressing dissent and sadness in society. Rocksteady particularly resonated with the disenfranchised youth who formed the rude boy subculture. “The rude boys became a particularly violent symbol of the poor’s resistance against economic exploitation and inequality.” (King, 2001, p. 32) The rocksteady music gave voice to the oppressed. The music was reflective of the sufferings and triumphs felt against oppressive systems. </p>

        <p>“Many rocksteady and ska musicians were united in representing the frustrations of the lower classes in Jamaica.” (King, 2001, p. 36)  Ska music was characterized by its upbeat tempo and infectious energy, blending traditional Jamaican musical elements with influences from American R&B and jazz. It provided an escape from the harsh reality of everyday life. Rocksteady was a “music [genre that] was "steadier" and
          "rockier," but it also was "ruder" and more political.” (King, 2001, p. 36) “Like ska, rocksteady featured "crying" as a common theme. Yet rock-steady musicians started to redirect this feeling from the personal pain of lost love to encompass the suffering experienced in the ghetto.” (King, 2001, p. 36) Rocksteady and ska became a means of fighting for the marginalized. They became soundtracks for navigating the complexities of everyday life, carrying echoes of the pain and oppression felt by the rural Jaimaicans. </p>
          
          <p>Reggae music carried with it this same essence of social commentary and yearning for social justice. It became deeply intertwined with the Rastafarian movement’s message of black liberation and repatriation to Africa. It combined African, Caribbean, and American musical traditions. “The growing line of resistance in Jamaica reflected the poor’s “bold assertion of a black radical consciousness [that] challenged the political and moral leadership of the dominant classes”(Gray 115). “ (King, 2001, p. 27)  While reggae's development was significantly shaped by the social and economic realities of Jamaican society, including the experiences of those living in ghettos, the music transcended geographical boundaries, resonating with those who identified with its message of resistance against oppression and calls for social justice. The music became a powerful symbol of their personal identities, reflecting their struggles, hopes, endurance and resilience that characterized their journey. </p>
