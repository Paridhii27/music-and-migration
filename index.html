      <h1>Music, Migration and Memories</h1>
      <p>Migration has been an important element for cultural exchange through the years. Bringing with it diverse music, art, languages and experiences across spatial and temporal boundaries. In the early years there was little interest in the phenomenon of migration in regards to music other than how it related to the diffusion of artefacts such as musical instruments from one culture to another. (Baily & Collyer, 2006, p. 168) However, over the years migrants have now been identified as catalysts for cultural exchange leading to fusion of music styles and emergence of new musical genres. Such music serves as a repository of shared experiences, cultural heritage, and emotions connecting the past to the present. The music that emerges from migration often serves as a powerful dual force. At times, it acts as a painful reminder of the hardships and losses of the past, evoking feelings of longing, grief, or nostalgia. At other times, it becomes a means for the migrant to maintain a sense of connection to their home, tethering them to their roots as they navigate life in an unfamiliar land. </p>

        <p>The circumstances of migration are often critical as well as it shapes the way a culture is remembered and highlights the amalgamation of one’s past cultural identity with their present reality and circumstances. As the migrants are displaced from “a culture which is familiar to them to one that is not, in which they are likely to be in a minority”. (Baily & Collyer, 2006, p. 170)  There is also an urge for them to find a sense of belonging in the world. The memories of the migrants are like a personal lens to the past. These memories are reflective of their lived human experiences and feelings and music possesses a unique ability of bridging both spatial and temporal distances to help them maintain a connection to their homeland and in encapsulating their cultural and personal identities.
