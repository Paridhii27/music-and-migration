        Music is a powerful tool for preserving and transmitting cultural
        memory, especially for displaced communities. In the early years there
        was little interest in the phenomenon of migration in regards to music
        other than how it related to the diffusion of artefacts such as musical
        instruments from one culture to another. However, over the years
        migrants have now been identified as catalysts for cultural exchange
        leading to fusion of music styles and emergence of new musical genres.
        Songs are repositories of shared experiences, values, and historical
        narratives. It possesses a unique ability to evoke memories and emotions
        that transcend language barriers. What are examples of memories which
        are preserved in music that emerges from migrations of people? What kind
        of emotions do these memories evoke?
